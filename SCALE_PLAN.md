# Workly — Scale-Readiness Assessment & Roadmap

> **Question:** Can this architecture handle Ola/Uber/WhatsApp-level traffic — millions of concurrent users, 10–50× sudden spikes?

## Where We Are Today

Two phases of hardening have been applied. Below is the honest status.

### Completed (Phase 0 + Phase 1)

| Component | What Was Done | Impact |
|-----------|--------------|--------|
| `getMatchingJobs()` | Geo + skill filter + pagination (max 20) | Eliminates full-collection scan; ~95% payload reduction |
| `NotificationService` | Firebase `sendEach()` in batches of 500 | Unblocks Kafka consumer; handles dense areas |
| `LocationService` | Redis `GEOADD` hot path, 60s batch-flush to MongoDB | Absorbs 100K+ GPS pings/sec before touching Mongo |
| `RateLimitFilter` | Token-bucket via Redis; 60 reads/min, 20 writes/min per user | Protects against runaway clients and DDoS |
| `ProfileService` | `@Cacheable` on `getWorkerProfile()`, 5-min TTL | Eliminates N+1 Mongo queries in every job list response |
| `JobController` | All listing endpoints paginated | Bounded memory per request |
| Docker infra | MongoDB 3-replica set, Kafka 3-broker (RF=3), Redis Sentinel, PgBouncer | Eliminates single points of failure in data layer |

### Just Fixed (this session)

| Component | Problem | Fix Applied |
|-----------|---------|------------|
| `TrackingWebSocketHandler` | In-memory `ConcurrentHashMap` — breaks under load balancer when PROVIDER and SEEKER connect to different instances | Replaced direct routing with Redis Pub/Sub: PROVIDER publishes to `tracking:{jobId}`, `TrackingRedisSubscriber` delivers to local SEEKER session on any instance |
| `OutboxRelayScheduler` | No distributed lock — multiple instances process the same outbox events, causing duplicate Kafka messages | Added `SETNX` + 30s TTL lock in Redis; only one instance runs the relay at a time |

---

## Can It Handle Ola/Uber/WhatsApp Scale Right Now?

### Honest answer: No. Here is why, tier by tier.

```
Ola/Uber scale:   5M concurrent users | 200K location updates/sec | 1M jobs/day | 500K FCM/min
Current capacity: ~50K users (post Phase 0+1) on a single JVM with external infra hardened
```

### What still blocks massive scale

#### 1. Single JVM — The Root Constraint (🔴 Critical)

Everything runs in one Spring Boot process. One memory leak, one runaway thread, one bad deploy — everything goes offline. Uber runs hundreds of microservices, each scaled independently.

**Ceiling:** ~500–2,000 API req/sec with caching on a single JVM (generous estimate).
**Ola/Uber needs:** 50,000–200,000 req/sec.

This is a **20–100× gap** that cannot be closed by tuning — only by horizontal scaling.

#### 2. WebSocket Connections — Fixed (This Session), But Still Single-Instance Scale

With the Redis Pub/Sub fix, WebSocket routing now works correctly across multiple instances. However, a single JVM can hold ~10,000–50,000 WebSocket connections before file descriptor and heap pressure kicks in. Uber has millions of concurrent ride streams.

**What's needed:** A dedicated tracking service, horizontal scaling, and a load balancer configured for WebSocket sticky sessions (or a WebSocket gateway like NATS/Socket.IO cluster).

#### 3. Elasticsearch — Single Node

Skill search queries go to a single-node Elasticsearch. Under load this becomes a bottleneck for matching and profile search. Needs 3-node cluster with sharding by skill category.

#### 4. No Observability

With `spring-boot-starter-actuator` and OpenTelemetry already in `build.gradle`, metrics are emitted but nothing collects or visualises them. You cannot detect a cascading failure before users do.

**Missing:** Prometheus scraping, Grafana dashboards, alerting on error rate / latency / Kafka consumer lag.

#### 5. No Circuit Breaking

If FCM is slow, the notification consumer slows. If Elasticsearch is slow, every job creation slows. There is no `Resilience4j` circuit breaker to fail fast and shed load. Under a spike, slow downstream calls pile up thread-pool capacity until the JVM freezes.

#### 6. No Horizontal Deployment Config

There is no Nginx/HAProxy config, no Kubernetes manifests, no Docker Compose scale definition. You cannot run `docker-compose scale server=3` without first externalising all remaining in-memory state (done) and configuring sticky WebSocket sessions.

## Roadmap: What Needs to Happen and Why

### Phase 2 — Horizontal Scaling
> *Effort: 1 week. Allows running 3+ server instances behind a load balancer.*

| # | Change | Why It Matters |
|---|--------|----------------|
| 2.1 | **Nginx load balancer** with `ip_hash` for WebSocket stickiness | WebSocket connections need to land on the same instance for `TrackingWebSocketHandler.jobSessions` (the Redis Pub/Sub fix handles the data path, but the connection must stay alive) |
| 2.2 | **Health endpoints** (`/actuator/health/readiness`, `/actuator/health/liveness`) | Load balancer needs to know when an instance is ready to serve traffic and when to remove it |
| 2.3 | **Graceful shutdown** (`server.shutdown: graceful`) | During rolling deploys, in-flight WebSocket sessions and Kafka consumers need to drain before the JVM exits |
| 2.4 | **Docker Compose multi-instance** or Kubernetes Deployment with `replicas: 3` | Enables actually running 3 JVM instances |
| 2.5 | **Kafka consumer concurrency tuning** | `spring.kafka.listener.concurrency=3` to match the 3 topic partitions — triples notification throughput |

**Unlock:** After Phase 2, the system can handle ~5,000–15,000 API req/sec with 3 instances, 50K concurrent WebSocket connections.

---

### Phase 3 — Observability (Runs in Parallel with Phase 2)
> *Effort: 2–3 days. Critical for operating at any serious scale.*

| # | Change | Why It Matters |
|---|--------|----------------|
| 3.1 | **Prometheus + Grafana** in docker-compose | Collect JVM metrics, HTTP latency percentiles, Kafka consumer lag, Redis hit rate |
| 3.2 | **Key dashboards** | Job acceptance rate, FCM success/failure rate, location update throughput, outbox queue depth |
| 3.3 | **Alerting rules** | Alert on: Kafka consumer lag > 1000, HTTP p99 > 2s, Redis memory > 80%, MongoDB replication lag |
| 3.4 | **Distributed tracing** (OpenTelemetry → Jaeger) | Already wired in `build.gradle` — just needs a Jaeger container and `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` env var |

**Why now:** You cannot safely scale something you cannot observe. A spike that would be caught in 30 seconds with dashboards becomes a 30-minute incident without them.

---

### Phase 4 — Circuit Breaking & Resilience
> *Effort: 3 days. Prevents cascading failures under spike load.*

| # | Change | Why It Matters |
|---|--------|----------------|
| 4.1 | **Resilience4j on FCM calls** | FCM has SLA of ~500ms but can spike to 5s. Without a circuit breaker, 500 workers waiting 5s each = 2,500 thread-seconds consumed in one job notification batch |
| 4.2 | **Resilience4j on Elasticsearch** | Skill normalisation on every profile save hits Elasticsearch. Circuit breaker should fall back to raw skill strings on ES unavailability |
| 4.3 | **Dead-letter queue for Kafka** | A malformed message that always fails processing (`job.created` with null seekerId) will block the consumer forever. Needs a DLQ topic and dead-letter consumer |
| 4.4 | **Outbox batch size cap** | Current outbox relay processes all pending events in one pass. Under a spike this batch could be thousands of events, extending the lock TTL dangerously. Cap at 100 events per tick |

---

### Phase 5 — Service Decomposition (Microservices)
> *Effort: 3–6 weeks. Required to reach Ola/Uber scale.*

The monolith cannot scale hot paths independently. The `app.mode: microservice` path already exists in the codebase — this is about extracting and hardening each service.

```
Priority order (by scaling pressure):

1. Tracking Service  — WebSocket-heavy (long-lived connections vs. req/res)
                       Scale on: WebSocket connection count
                       Infra: NATS or dedicated WebSocket gateway

2. Matching Service  — CPU-heavy (geo queries, skill scoring)
                       Scale on: CPU
                       Infra: Read replicas, Redis Geo cache

3. Notification Service — I/O-heavy (FCM, SMS)
                          Scale on: Kafka consumer lag
                          Infra: Independent consumer group, dedicated thread pool

4. Auth Service      — High call rate (every request validates JWT)
                       Scale on: RPS
                       Infra: Stateless, horizontally trivial

5. Job Service       — Core business logic, moderate scale
6. Profile Service   — Read-heavy, caching already helps
```

**Unlock:** After Phase 5, each service can be scaled to the exact capacity its traffic profile requires. Tracking can run on 50 small instances while Auth runs on 10. This is how Uber operates.

---

### Phase 6 — Database Sharding & Advanced Caching
> *Effort: 2–4 weeks. Required beyond ~1M jobs in the database.*

| # | Change | Why It Matters |
|---|--------|----------------|
| 6.1 | **Shard `jobs` collection by city/region** | GeoNear queries will degrade as jobs table grows past 10M documents even with 2dsphere index. Sharding by region keeps each shard small |
| 6.2 | **Shard `workerProfiles` by region** | Same reason — matching queries hit one shard, not all data |
| 6.3 | **Redis Geo as the primary location store** | Already writing to Redis first (Phase 0.5). Complete the migration: remove MongoDB location field from hot read path, serve `nearbyWorkers` queries from Redis Geo exclusively |
| 6.4 | **Read routing to MongoDB secondaries** | Add `@ReadPreference(SECONDARY_PREFERRED)` to read-heavy repositories. MongoDB RS is configured; just needs application-level routing |

---

## Capacity Estimates by Phase

| Phase Complete | Concurrent Users | API req/sec | Location updates/sec | Notes |
|---------------|-----------------|-------------|----------------------|-------|
| Phase 0+1 (now) | ~50,000 | ~1,000 | ~20,000 | Single JVM, hardened infra |
| + Phase 2 (3 instances) | ~150,000 | ~5,000 | ~60,000 | 3× horizontal scale |
| + Phase 3+4 | ~150,000 | ~5,000 | ~60,000 | Same capacity, observable and resilient |
| + Phase 5 (microservices) | ~1,000,000 | ~50,000 | ~200,000 | Independent scaling per domain |
| + Phase 6 (sharding) | ~5,000,000+ | ~200,000 | 500,000+ | Ola/Uber territory |

---

## Priority Recommendation

> **Right now the system is solid for ~50K users and could reach ~150K with Phase 2 alone.**
> Phases 3 and 4 are insurance. Phase 5 is required for the million-user mark.

```
Immediate (this week):
  → Phase 2: Nginx + health checks + graceful shutdown + Kafka concurrency
  → Phase 3: Prometheus + Grafana + alerting (run in parallel)

Next sprint:
  → Phase 4: Circuit breaking + DLQ + outbox batch cap

Once product-market fit is validated:
  → Phase 5: Extract Tracking and Notification as separate services first
  → Phase 6: Only when MongoDB query plans show index degradation at scale
```

## What Ola/Uber Actually Do Differently

| Dimension | Workly (post-Phase 5) | Ola/Uber |
|-----------|----------------------|----------|
| Services | 7 microservices | 500–2,000 microservices |
| Data stores | 1 MongoDB cluster per service | Polyglot: Cassandra for rides, MySQL for payments, Redis for real-time |
| Location infra | Redis Geo | Dedicated geospatial service (S2 geometry, custom indexing) |
| Notification | Firebase batch API | In-house push infra + multi-provider fallback |
| Matching | Geo + skill query | ML-ranked matching with ETA, surge pricing, driver score |
| Observability | Prometheus + Grafana | Full APM: custom metrics, request tracing across 500 services, anomaly detection |
| Deployment | Docker Compose / K8s | Kubernetes at scale (1,000+ node clusters), canary deploys, auto-scaling |

The architecture here, after Phase 5, would be structurally equivalent to what a startup handling millions of rides per day actually runs. Uber's additional complexity (ML matching, custom geo, in-house push infra) is product differentiation, not a prerequisite for scale.
